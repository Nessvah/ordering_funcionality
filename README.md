### Requirements

- Follow the design spec (Figma file)
- Render the three menu options using Javascript
- Be able to add/remove items
- Have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs

### Stretch goals (optional)

- [ ] Offer a "meal deal" discount
- [ ] Allow users to rate their experience

### Optimizations/Problems to solve (optional):
- [ ] The form doesn't work as expected. Altough it has required attr, the event listener overlaps and the user is able to "submit" form with empty fields.
